Welcome to Math Duel!


ABOUT THE GAME:


Math Duel is a game about competition and strategic decisions. Math Duel is played with 3 players. The topics the Math Duel questions are based off of are binomials,functions and polynomials. There are 3 difficulties and 3 topics. There are 27 questions in total, leaving 3 questions per difficulty-topic points (e.g 3 easy function questions and 3 hard polynomial questions). This game is made for students to practice their math knowledge on important topic of math while making it fun.


BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT GAMEPLAY:

The person who starts out in the first turn is selected randomly. Afterwards, the order increases until Player 3 uses up their turn, which then resets the order back to Player 1. There is a timer above the given question to count the amount of time players take to solve questions. This information will be displayed along with the score at the end of the game. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, there are 3 difficulties; easy, normal and hard. The player gets differing amount of points depending on the difficulty of the question they answer. They get a point for solving an easy question, 2 points for a normal question and 3 points for a hard question. Upon answering a question correctly, the player who answered the question has a chance of getting an item. Here are all the items in the game and their use:


Extrap:

Extrap is a simple item that gets used upon clicking "e" while the user is playing their turn. This action does not use up their turn. After using, the user will get an extra point from any question next turn if they answer correctly. There are no penalties upon incorrectly answering a question exception of the player losing their Extrap and their turn. The item is shown as  "+1" on the player's screen.


Multiplier:

Multiplier is a more risky version of the Extrap with better benefits. It gets used upon clicking "m" while the user is playing their turn. This action does not use up their turn. After using, the user will get twice the points they would normally get upon answering a question correctly. Beware, though. If the user gets a question answered incorrectly, they will lose points depending on the question's difficulty. The item is shown as "x2" on the player's screen.


Thief:

Thief is a useful tool for sabotaging your opponents while benefiting yourself. It gets used upon clicking "t" while the user is playing their turn. This action does not use up their turn. After using, the user can steal any of the other user's items. Upon stealing, you will lose your Thief but you will get the victim's former item. The victim loses their item as well. You cannot steal from players who have no items. The item is shown as  "T" on the player's screen.


After all 27 questions are finished, the information of all 3 players will be displayed on the screen.
